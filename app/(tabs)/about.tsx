To achieve this, we aim to eliminate fake or paid reviews, as well as irrelevant feedback that does not reflect the quality of the product itself. This includes reviews such as 'just received, havenâ€™t tried yet' or comments solely focused on logistics rather than the product. We believe genuine and helpful reviews are key to making informed purchase decisions, and we appreciate your support in fostering an honest community!</Text>
